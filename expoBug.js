This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` file.  It can also arise from corrupted cache files or issues with the underlying Node.js environment.  The error message itself might not always point directly to the root cause, leading to troubleshooting difficulties.
