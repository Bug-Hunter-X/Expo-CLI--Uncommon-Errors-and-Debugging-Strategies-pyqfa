The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:
1. **Verify Expo CLI Version:** Ensure compatibility between your CLI version and the project's `package.json` dependencies. Use `expo --version` to check your CLI version and update as needed using `npm install -g expo-cli@latest`. 
2. **Clear Cache:**  Run `expo start --clear` to clear the Expo CLI cache and rebuild.  This often resolves issues related to corrupted cached files.
3. **Check Node.js Version:** Confirm that your Node.js version meets Expo's requirements.  Outdated or incompatible versions can lead to various problems. 
4. **Examine `package.json`:**  Thoroughly review your project's `package.json` file for dependency conflicts or outdated packages.  Resolve any issues found and reinstall dependencies using `npm install`.
5. **Examine Project Structure:** Ensure your project structure aligns with Expo's conventions.  Errors can arise from incorrect file placements or configurations.
6. **Check Environment Variables:**  Make sure environment variables (like paths) are correctly configured.
7. **Create a New Project:** If other troubleshooting steps fail, create a new Expo project to see if the issue is project-specific. Compare the new project's settings and structure with the problematic one to pinpoint discrepancies.
