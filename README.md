This repository demonstrates troubleshooting techniques for uncommon errors encountered while using the Expo CLI.  The `expoBug.js` file contains example code that might trigger these issues, while `expoBugSolution.js` provides solutions and explanations.  This is particularly helpful when dealing with vague error messages that don't immediately identify the source of the problem. The project is geared towards developers experiencing unusual behavior with the Expo CLI and needing assistance resolving complex issues not covered in typical documentation.
